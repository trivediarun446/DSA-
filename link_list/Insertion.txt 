 # Insertion at Starting 

 Approach :- 

* assume that link list is alread create 

 1) First of create tempory node name temp 
 2) Then the address part of the temp node is pointing towards the first node of link list 
 3) Head pointer now pointing towards the tempory node 

 code snipet : 

 node *temp 
 head = new node ( value )
 temp -> next = head 
 head = temp ; 
 
* If link list is not created 

1) First of all check the linked list is created or not 
2) If not then create a node 



---> code snipet for inserting the node in starting of linked list 

// creating a head pointer 
node * head ; 


if( head == null )
{
    head = new node (value);
}
else     // if linked list is created 
{
 node * temp ;
 temp = new node( value);
 temp -> next = head ; 
 head = temp ; 
}


Insertion at the End 

Approach : 

1) create a tail or current node which is traversing the linked list 
1) check the current or tail node is pointing towards the Null 
2) then create a new node which you want to insert 
3) The new node store the data and the null 
4) In last give the new node address to current or tail node 

code snipet : 

node * current = head;
// This is the case of traversing 
while( current-> next != null)
{
  current = current -> next ; 
}

// temp node creation 
node * temp ;
temp = new node(value);
current-> next = temp ;
